### 데이터베이스 정규화
https://wkdtjsgur100.github.io/database-normalization/

1. 1차 정규화 : 모든 속성이 atomic 값을 가지도록
2. 2차 정규화 : 부분 함수 종속(특정 칼럼이 기본 키가 아닌 다른 칼럼에 의해 결정되는 것) 제거  
  > 함수적 종속에서 X의 값이 여러 요소일 경우, 즉, {X1, X2} -> Y일 경우, X1와 X2가 Y의 값을 결정할 때 이를 완전 함수적 종속 이라고 하고, X1, X2 중 하나만 Y의 값을 결정할 때 이를 부분 함수적 종속 이라고 한다.
3. 3차 정규화 : 이행 함수 종속 제거
